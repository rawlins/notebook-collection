This repository is an archive for Jupyter notebooks that implement linguistic analyses in the areas of semantics and pragmatics. See [https://github.com/rawlins/lambda-notebook](https://github.com/rawlins/lambda-notebook) for a project that supports doing linguistic analysis of this type in a notebook. All of the notebooks in this archive currently require the lambda notebook kernel to be installed, and come from the lambda notebook project. For notebooks that appear in both repositories, the lambda-notebook version is the master.
